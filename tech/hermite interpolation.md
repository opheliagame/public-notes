one of many techniques for interpolation 
used widely in glsl [[smoothstep]] 

allows to approximate curve or function between known data points (example points on cartesian plane)

- position of data points 
- slope / derivative at data points 

to calculate intermediate points, uses polynomials (Hermite polynomials)
