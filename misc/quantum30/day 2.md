I started to read [Quantum Country](https://quantum.country/) today. I think it is a much better resource for me compared to watching videos. It is also quite an interesting approach to learning so I am looking forward to progressing with it. 


Things noted from today's videos 
- [[Deterministic world]] vs [[Probabilistic world]]
- Measurement collapses the wave function
	- It is not actually known how this happens 
- Superposition and the double slip experiment 
- [[Quantum Entanglement]]
- [[Quantum tunnelling]]
- [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]] 
- [[computers are a fundamental feature of the universe]] 
- [[qubit]]
