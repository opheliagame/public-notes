reasons for shadow variables 
- there are no assignment statements 
- expressions are evaluated "eagerly", the expression producing the value is irrelevant afterwards 

functions 


tuples vs list
list can have any number of elements
tuples commit to specific numbers

parts of a language 
- syntax - how to write
- semantics - evaluation rules
- idioms - typical patterns for using language features to express computation
- libraries
- tools - repl, debugger, code formatter
