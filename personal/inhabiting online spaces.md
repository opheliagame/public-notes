I was born in 1998. 
The first computer that I used for more than playing sudoku was given to me in 11th grade.  It could not upgrade to Windows 7. So I installed linux on it. And that is when my fascination with computers really began. That is when I made my first few sketches on processing; a house with rectangles and triangles; a house that only ever existed on paper but looked nothing like the house I actually lived in. 

I spend a lot of my time online. And just like physical spaces look and feel a certain way, online spaces do too.
