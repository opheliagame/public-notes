For quite some time, starting somewhere in my teens, I have thought of myself as a not very creative person. I still have some trouble thinking of myself as an artist, even though I feel more comfortable with the word than ever before. 

My grandfather was a government employee; an office going person. He also wrote scripts and stories. He travelled to Bombay, made a few movies, while also building his own house. All of this seems so fantastical to me. I never really got the chance to talk with him about these things. I wonder now whether he thought of himself as a creative person.
