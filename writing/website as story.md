# Things I think about 

- What is the difference between writing code and writing poems? What are the similarities between writing code and writing poems? 
- Can a website be a poem? Or [many other things](https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/) beyond it rather than a way to sell things? 
- What is website art?
