Gudetama (ぐでたま) [^1] is definitely my favorite Sanrio character. One of the many reasons I love watching the usually short around ten minute episodes that Gudetama finds himself in, is that I can see him living out life in the way that I want to sometimes. It is a raw egg, and it makes absolutely no effort to be anything else. It tries to, it fails sometimes, but eventually things pan out and he is back to being a raw egg, plain and simple. 

I don't watch Gudetama for the enjoyment of the character development or arc; I don't think anyone who enjoys watching Gudetama does. We know Gudetama, and the simple things it values. It always pleasantly comes back to that. 

So then why do people enjoy watching a perpetually tired raw egg that doesn't want to do absolutely anything. Sometimes there are other characters that try to make Gudetama do things (he becomes the Prime Minister of Japan once, after the actual Prime Minister convinces it to not give up on itself yet), and he does them, or ends up becoming a part of someone else's ambition. But even when there aren't, Gudetama can take up the entire screen quite comfortably idly talking about everything that happens to him. 

When there are other characters involved, there is a lot more happening, but everything gets tied together around Gudetama or sometimes just a single word like カラザ [^2]. You watch episodes that may or may not be connected to each other, in a linear, sometimes non-linear fashion, holding on to Gudetama.
