🐞 🪲 🐛 🕷️ 🐜 

As someone who works in tech, I know that most developers do not have a good sense of colors and typography. Even if they do, that is not really their job on the team. There is design and implementation; existing separately as well as within each other.

I have myself mostly worked within the second box, and so I do not have much experience yet talking to clients or conducting user research, but one thing that I have come to understand about design is that while not everyone can create a good design, most people understand bad design intuitively. 


The purpose of design changes from context to context, but it is never just to change the appearance. A more central role it plays is providing value.

Making things that are tangible or non-tangible has immense power to not just change how people do things, but also how they think. If you have been living with bad design, good design might feel challenging initially but once the pieces come together you can't help but think why anyone would do things differently.
